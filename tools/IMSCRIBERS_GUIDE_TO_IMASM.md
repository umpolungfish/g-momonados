# The Imscriber's Guide to IMASM

**What it is.** The single comprehensive reading of IMASM: the 12-opcode classic
tower and the 14-opcode SIXTEEN_3 trilattice extension presented as one continuous
grammar family, statics and dynamics together. It coagulates the former
`IMASM_QUICKREF.md`, `IMASM_DYNAMICS.md`, and `md/imasm_composition_rules.md`
into one document.

**What it does.** Teaches everything needed to write, wire, judge, run, compose,
and survey IMASM programs: the alphabet, how a word becomes a graph, the ancestry
pairing rule, the close condition, the four verdicts, the register and the gates,
the three-verdict discipline, the composition law, ChaosComposer, the op-opcode
level, the 49 types, and where the engine itself lives and runs.

**Why it matters.** IMASM is the Grammar's executable face: a decision expressed
as a word and put to `check` receives a univocal structural verdict, and the same
close condition that judges reasoning here is the gate that judges the vita
trunk's speech on bare metal. One grammar, one judge, every substrate.

**How to use it.** Read Parts I to III to write and judge words; Part IV onward
for dynamics, composition, and the wider machinery. Semantics track
`ask_native/src/imasm.rs` and `imasm_core/src/check.rs`; run `imasm ref` for the
live rules. Where this guide and a live tool ever disagree, the tool is right.

## Part I. The Alphabet

A program is a DIRECTED GRAPH of opcodes, not a line. One glyph each; the
alphabet is fully SYMBOLIC (no Latin initials, so no token ever collides with a
verdict letter). WORK? asks: does the opcode TRANSFORM the object?

Twelve opcodes, and the same twelve glyphs are the primitive alphabet, one per
axis, because the opcodes and the axes were always the same twelve. The
trilattice face adds the two bit-swap negations and reads $⊞$ as EVALI. Nothing in
the set already means something else in mathematics: that is what it is for.

THERE IS ONE DYAD, $∈$ and $∋$, and it has as many arms as the carrier gives it. δ
cuts the register into a PARTITION, and which partition depends on how many arms
it has: {T,t} | {F,f} at two, and {T} | {F} | {t,f} at three, the truth cut taken
inside the constructive block with the non-constructive pair held whole. Both are
partitions of the four base values, so μ∘δ = id at either arity. On the classical
slice, where t and f are absent, the three-arm cut IS the two-arm cut: the
information arm carries nothing. A fan of two is this opcode with an empty arm,
not a different opcode, which is why there is one mark and not two.

The arity is not a choice either. $⊞$ sets t and f together, so the
non-constructive pair can only ever be entered as a block, and three is what the
gate set leaves. Note what this rules out: the two-arm cut is not the three-arm
cut with an arm dropped. Dropping the information arm leaves {T} | {F}, which
loses t and f and would not recover its input. They coincide on the slice, not by
truncation.

One operator therefore means one ancestry rule, one close condition, one engine.
A fuse pairs with the fork that ALL of its in-arms trace back to, which at two
arms is the "two distinct in-arms" rule unchanged and at three is the
tri-ancestral rule.

```

TWELVE opcodes, no more. The set is `$⊣$$⊢$$≺$$≻$$⊙$$∈$$∋$$⊤$$⊥$$⋈$$⊞$$⊡$`, and ROTAT `↺/↻` (the cyclic
shift, below) is the op-opcode that acts ON a word, not a thirteenth letter in it.

The WORK? column is the most-missed rule: $⊢$ $⊣$ $⊙$ $∈$ $∋$ $∈$ $∋$ do NOT transform. An
arm carrying only $⊙$ (or nothing) is an identity arm, and a closure over identity
arms verifies nothing. $⊙$ is self-reference, not work.

WORDS: tokens glued as one string, no spaces, e.g. `$⊢$$≻$$∈$$⊤$$⊙$$∋$$⊡$$⊣$`. Space-separated
full names parse identically (VINIT AFWD ...), as do the short forms
VI TA AF AR CL IM FS FF ET EF EG IX and the aliases δ μ ═ for $∈$ $∋$ =.

Glyph provenance: the alphabet is chosen against a single rule, that a mark must
not arrive already meaning something else. VINIT $⊢$ and TANCH $⊣$ are the opening
and closing boundary turnstiles; EVALT $⊤$ and EVALF $⊥$ are the two poles they
evaluate; the dyad is $∈$ and $∋$, membership out of one and into one; CLINK $⋈$ is the
join; IFIX $⊡$ is the box that closes; ENGAGR $⊞$ is the Belnap Both it holds; and
IMSCRIB is $⊙$ because imscribing IS INCLOSURE, the monadic operation itself, hence
self-referential and referenced self-referentially: a boundary around its own
centre, denoting the act of denoting. The retired spellings ◇ ● = + × ¬ ~ ≁
carried arithmetic, equality, and layer-negation into a language that has none of
them, which is what the set was changed to stop. They are not tokens and do not
parse; the twelve above are the whole alphabet.

The same twelve are the primitive alphabet, one glyph per axis in slot order:
$⊢$ Dimensionality, $⊣$ Topology, $≻$ Relational, $≺$ Polarity, $⋈$ Fidelity, $⊙$ Kinetics,
$∈$ Granularity, $∋$ Grammar, $⊤$ Criticality, $⊥$ Chirality, $⊞$ Stoichiometry,
$⊡$ Protection. Not a mapping between two alphabets: one alphabet, read as an
operation or as an axis according to where it stands. The serpent eats its tail.
Valences follow IMSCRIBr `tokens.py::TOKEN_ARITY`.

## Part II. From Word to Graph

A word is only the node list. The EDGES are supplied by the verb you build with:

```
  chain <word>           wire head→tail, nothing reconnects        (β=0, one strand)
  ring <word>            wire head→tail→head; fork/fuse NOT rejoined (β=1)
  protocol <word>        wire so $∈$/$∋$ pairs RECONNECT (δ arm → μ): the way to CLOSE
  bubble PRE:A:B:POST    $∈$→(A|B)→$∋$ reconvergence, spelled out
  star CORE:a:b:c        hub + arms (≥3)
  comb BACKBONE:p arm:q arm   backbone + grafts
  wire N0 N1 … / i-j i-k …    free graph: node set / edge set
```

Same word + different verb = different graph = different verdict.
`chain $⊢$$∈$$⊤$$⊥$$∋$$⊣$` and `protocol $⊢$$∈$$⊤$$⊥$$∋$$⊣$` are not the same program. To CLOSE, use
`protocol`, never a bare `ring`, and never close by looping back to $⊢$ (a source,
in-arity 0).

### Which $∈$ pairs with which $∋$

By ANCESTRY, not by text position and not by a fork-balance stack. A ($∈$,$∋$) pair
exists when two distinct in-arms of the $∋$ trace back to a common $∈$: the fork was
undone by the fuse, HOWEVER IT ROUTED. Consequences:

- Pairing is a property of the EDGES, so the same word wired two ways pairs
  differently. You cannot read pairing off the glyph string alone.
- A $∈$ feeding a $∋$ directly (empty arm) still counts: in-edges are counted with
  multiplicity, and a $∈$ is its own ancestor.
- Arms are the nodes strictly between $∈$ and $∋$: forward-reachable from the fork
  AND backward-reachable from the fuse. That set is what gets checked for WORK.
- A $∋$ may have SEVERAL qualifying $∈$ (upstream forks reach downstream fuses on
  any strand). It pairs with the INNERMOST: the candidate no other candidate
  descends from. So a $∈$ may close more than one $∋$, but a $∋$ closes with exactly
  one $∈$, and an upstream fork cannot claim the fuse a nearer fork actually forked.
- fully_closed means EVERY $∈$ and EVERY $∋$ participates in some pair. One dangler
  and the whole program is Open.

The rule above is already the general one: ALL the in-arms, however many the
fuse has. At two that reads "two distinct in-arms" and at three "all three",
which is why the tri dyad needs no rule of its own. Same innermost rule, same
multiplicity rule. Neutral inflation is allowed: `$⊢$$∈$$⊙$$⊙$$⊙$$∋$$⊣$` is valid tri
reconnection with no work, and reads N (identity), the same as `$⊢$$∈$$⊙$$⊙$$⊙$$∋$$⊣$`.

`protocol` wires as many arms as the fork's arity declares: one along the chain
and the rest straight across. At arity 2 that is the single empty arm it always
drew; at arity 3, two.

For a plain strand the stack reading (each $∋$ takes the nearest unfused $∈$)
happens to agree, and such words may be bracketed for READING BY EYE:
`$⊢$$⊙$$⋈$[$∈$$≻$$⊤$$≺$$⊞$$⊥$$∋$]$⊡$$⊡$$⊣$`, nesting as nested brackets. Three caveats, all load-bearing:
brackets are NOT input (they parse to nothing, so a bracketed word reports
N void); the aid works for strands ONLY; and it is not the pairing rule.
Ancestry is. The two coincide on a strand and part company the moment edges
route otherwise.

## Part III. The Close Condition and the Verdicts

A program CLOSES iff BOTH hold:

1. RECONNECTION: every brancher ($∈$ or $∈$) and every merger ($∋$ or $∋$) participates
   in an ancestry pair, and
2. TRANSFORMATION: at least one such pair carries a WORK opcode on its arms.

A bare cycle is NOT a closure; β (loops) is never diagnostic. Split→fuse with
nothing between is μ∘δ=id, which type-checks nothing. The close condition is
μ∘δ over a TRANSFORMED object: split, work, fuse.

### Verdicts (from `check` / `imasm16_3 check`, identical logic)

```
  T (closes)        μ∘δ closes over n transformed reconnections → proceed
  N (identity)      $∈$/$∋$ reconnect but no WORK between → put work on the arms
  N (no fork)       no δ/μ dyad at all → never weighed alternatives
  N (void)          no committed opcodes: nothing parsed → write a real word
  B (open)          well-typed, but a $∈$ or $∋$ dangles unreconnected → fuse it ($∋$)
                    or commit one arm (¬)
  B (paradox held)  closes over a transformation AND a $⊞$ is present → genuinely
                    both. Sound to hold; do NOT read it as a clean T; look again
                    before an irreversible ¬.
  F (ill-typed)     grammar violated → revise
```

B BEATS T: a word that closes but contains ENGAGR reports B, never T. Holding a
paradox is sound, but it is not a clean pass.

F is exactly three errors: a non-brancher fanning out, a non-merger merging in,
or any node exceeding its own arity. Nothing else is fatal.

OPEN VALENCES ARE NOT ERRORS. An arm that runs out of successors is a living /
telechelic end: reported as "open valences (living ends): n out, m in; reactive,
not errors". $⊣$ may end with its out-port open; $⊢$ may start with its in-port open.

### Topology names (from `classify`)

Named by invariants, not by fork balance. β = E − V + C (independent loops):

```
  trivial   no nodes
  linear    β=0, no branch points: a single strand
  star      β=0, branch points forming ONE contiguous hub, ≥3 arms
  comb      β=0, branch points strung along a backbone: graft/comb tree
  ring      β=1, no branch and no merge points: single cycle, no pendants
  branched  β=1 with branch or merge points
  network   β≥2, or more than one disconnected strand
```

Reported with: V, E, β, branch/merge/src/sink census, arm count, and spectral
radius ρ. Star caveat: the abstract star K(1,f) has ρ=√f, but IMASM fan-out caps
at 2 ($∈$ is out-2), so a hub is REALIZED as a caterpillar of f−1 $∈$ fan-nodes and
the true ρ tends to 2, not √f.

## Part IV. The Carrier and the Gates (dynamics)

The register is a SIXTEEN_3 value: a subset of the four base values {T, F, t, f}
(Shramko, Dunn and Takenaka's trilattice, "The Trilattice of Constructive Truth
Values", J. Logic and Computation 11(6):761-788, 2001; T constructively proven,
F constructively refuted, t acceptable, f rejectable), sixteen states from
N = {} to A = {T,F,t,f}. FOUR is not a second system: it is the classical slice
{T, F} of the same carrier, with Belnap B = {T,F} and N = {}. One evaluator runs
both; `eval` renders the slice (N/T/F/B), `eval16` renders the full names. A
value that touches t or f has left the slice and keeps its 16_3 name in either
view. NOT two independent FOURs, NOT three independent bits: one 4-bit register,
verified against the paper's own worked example (T ∧ t = N under the truth order).

Three orderings, each with a meet/join (`imasm16_3 algebra <op> A B`):

```
  ≤_i information     x ⊆ y                                            ⊓/⊔
  ≤_t truth           x∩{T,t} ⊆ y∩{T,t}  and  y∩{F,f} ⊆ x∩{F,f}        ∧/∨
  ≤_c constructivity  x∩{T,F} ⊆ y∩{T,F}  and  y∩{t,f} ⊆ x∩{t,f}        △/▽
```

Flow uses ≤_i: shuttling only ever moves values up the information order. AREV `$≺$`
is the trilattice negation, and it factors into two bit-SWAPS (not flips), one per
layer: the paper requires negation to preserve ≤_i exactly, and swapping two bits
preserves |x| where a flip would not. Those factors are not independent operators —
`$≺$` alone carries Tf to Ft, and on the classical slice `$≺$` carries T to F by
itself. The retired marks ~ ≁ once spelled the two factors; the twelve-opcode core
needs no room for either, and $⊡$ IFIX replaces them.

### The gates

Every opcode is a gate over the carrier. Inputs join by union (the ≤_i join)
before the gate acts; the value leaving a gate rides every out-edge except where
δ fans.

```
  VINIT $⊢$          emits the seed (default B in the slice, A in full 16_3)
  FSPLIT $∈$ / $∈$     δ fans the register's own partition onto its arms: at two,
                   truth part x∩{T,t} and falsity part x∩{F,f}; at three,
                   x∩{T}, x∩{F}, and the information part x∩{t,f}
  EVALT $⊤$          pass-gate: truth part
  EVALF $⊥$          pass-gate: falsity part
  EVALI $⊞$ (16_3)   sets the information layer (t and f)
  FFUSE $∋$ / $∋$      μ / μ₃ joins: union of the arms
  AREV $≺$           the involution T↔F, t↔f (its own inverse; fixes B and N).
                   Internally it factors as two disjoint-bit swaps, one per layer
                   (T↔F and t↔f); composing the two IS AREV. Those factors are not
                   opcodes and were never in the set — the retired marks ~ ≁ once
                   named them, and $⊡$ IFIX replaces those marks.
  AFWD $≻$, CLINK $⋈$, IMSCRIB $⊙$, ENGAGR $⊞$ (as hold)   carry
  IFIX $⊡$           carry and latch (the commit point)
  TANCH $⊣$          readout
```

Every gate is monotone in ≤_i, so evaluation is a Kleene iteration from all-N
edge values that settles in bounded rounds on any graph, cycles included. A loop
converges; it cannot oscillate. The machine's registers are the edges; IFIX
marks where value becomes commitment.

## Part V. The Three Independent Verdicts

A program earns three judgments, none implying another:

1. **Grammar** (`define`): the composition laws hold; only branchers branch,
   only mergers fuse, arities respected.
2. **Kernel** (`prove`): the closure class goes to the live p4ramill kernel. A
   worked dyad (split, transform, fuse) proves green; a bare fork-fuse is an
   identity closure and returns N for the program; a dangling fork is OPEN.
3. **Flow** (`eval` / `eval16`): per dyad, does the fuse RECOVER what the fork
   was fed? The canonical protocol word (`$⊢$$∈$$≻$$∋$$⊤$` as VINIT FSPLIT AFWD FFUSE
   EVALT) is lossless: B splits to (T,F) and fuses back to B, the operational
   split_fuse_id. The same shape with AREV on the truth arm closes in structure
   and fails in value: fed Tf, recovered Ff, NOT id. The arm inverted what it
   carried, and only flow can see that.

Flowing a catalog entry expands its twelve glyph types into opcode motifs, and
the per-dyad id/NOT-id sequence is a FLOW SIGNATURE: a readout of the tuple in
the dynamic register. Signatures discriminate between entries, and a lossy dyad
inside a kernel-green closure is not presumed a defect; it can be the entry's
chirality speaking in flow.

Discipline for any new program: define (grammar), prove (kernel), eval (flow),
and SPEAK THE EXPECTED READOUT BEFORE RUNNING EVAL. The gates are deterministic,
so the true name of a topology includes its flow.

## Part VI. The Composition Law

Programs interact end-to-valence. A living end is an unfilled port (a node below
its arity), the same reactive ends the engine always reported; they are the
register ports of the program as a component. `imasm compose <new> <A> <B>`
binds A's free out-ends to B's free in-ends, in node order, under three rules:

1. Composition CONSUMES valences and never mints one.
2. The composite must re-satisfy the grammar; an ill-typed binding is refused
   whole.
3. A program with no living ends does not compose. It is a finished loop; it is
   done.

Composites persist as wire specs, rebuild through the identical parse, and
remain composable while ends remain. Composition is therefore well-founded: each
step consumes ends, ends are finite, and the fixed point is a program with none.
This is the thesis (no lines, only loops, and autopoiesis) running as type
discipline: lines are the composable phase, loops are results, and the registry
census confirms it at scale, with roughly half the tools reactive material and
half finished loops.

## Part VII. ChaosComposer: the Possibility State Space

`chaos` takes a SET of programs (up to six). A set has no order, so the composer
walks every ordering, folds each through the binding law, and speaks the space
whole: which arrangements are admitted, which are refused and by which missing
end, and the collapse of orderings into OUTCOME CLASSES keyed by topology,
closure, flow, readout, and remaining living ends. The collapse is the
measurement: the space of possibilities is smaller than the space of orderings,
and the ratio says how constrained the set is. Refusals are results of equal
rank; a set of finished loops refuses every ordering, which is the type verdict
"these objects are done."

### Laws of flow found by walking spaces

- **Closure and flow-perfection can be in tension.** In one measured set,
  exactly one arrangement of twenty-four closed, a different one was
  flow-perfect, and none was both: closing forced a value through a lossy dyad.
- **The tension is not a law of the alphabet.** A census over sampled
  machine-shaped sets found spaces with closures, spaces with perfect flow, and
  a minority with both.
- **Perfect machines exist.** One set's whole possibility space is terminal
  objects: every admitted arrangement is CLOSED, flow-perfect, and ends with
  zero living ends. One is minted as `perfect_machine`, kernel green, every fuse
  recovering B.
- **The mechanism is exact.** The involution fixes B and N, so AREV costs
  nothing while an invol-symmetric value flows; it mints the missing pole when
  fed a PROJECTED value (invol(T) = F). Therefore AREV is lossless exactly on
  invol-symmetric values, and closure/flow tension appears precisely where a
  projection feeds an inversion. Both conditions are readable off the program
  before it runs, so an arrangement's capacity for perfection is part of its
  true name, speakable in advance and confirmable by the tools.

## Part VIII. Op-Opcodes: Operators on Words, Not Nodes

A node-opcode is a symbol inside a word; a VERB turns a word into a graph. An
OP-OPCODE is a third thing: a map that acts on the whole composition and returns
another composition. It is NOT one of the opcodes, and appending its name as a
token does nothing; it is not a node. It transforms the word.

**ROTAT**: the cyclic shift of a ring, rotate the word by one, k → k+1. The ring
automorphism. ρ and every spectral invariant are ROTAT-invariant (that
invariance IS the signal that ROTAT is a symmetry, not that it is inert). On ONE
ring it changes nothing measurable; between TWO rings being bound it sets their
RELATIVE phase, the degree of freedom that seats a junction two same-handed
(isotactic) rings cannot close on their own (the θ=0.50 co-typing termination).
ROTAT is the Weyl-Heisenberg shift X on ℤ/dℤ; the SIC displacement D_{a,b}
carries ROTAT^a. The balanced tiling of a period-n cycle is unique UP TO ROTAT.

Op-opcodes are open: ROTAT `↺/↻` is the first named one (↺ shifts k→k−1, ↻ shifts
k→k+1). Its relative is reflection (the half-period involution ROTAT^{d/2}). The
two-layer swaps that AREV `$≺$` factors into also act on the register rather than the
word, but they are internal to `$≺$`, not op-opcodes and not set members; the retired
marks ~ ≁ once named them and $⊡$ IFIX replaces those marks. The class was surfaced by the
necessity of binding two isotactic rings; no node-opcode rotates one ring
against another, so the operation had to live one level up, on the word itself.

## Part IX. The Types: the Strange Loop

Every TYPE the Grammar writes with is itself a full IMASM program. `imasm types`
lists the 49 Shavian type names (ado, air, ash, awe, ...); `imasm expand <type>`
locates the `the_primitive_type_called_<name>` ob3ect, pulls its ordered
bootstrap opcodes and fork/fuse pairs, and hands back the reconstructed graph
plus the per-step domain actions. The types judge programs, and the types ARE
programs judged by the same close condition: the strange loop is not decoration,
it is the autopoietic floor of the system.

The loop is walkable in both directions. A tuple becomes a word by writing each
of its twelve types as that type's own program and concatenating in canonical
axis order; `imasm cycle` runs the return leg too, reading a word back into the
types that could have written it, and reports where the round trip closes. Three
things it establishes. Type programs are NOT self-delimiting (the type `out`
carries TANCH in its middle and does not end on $⊣$), so a concatenated word must
be parsed axis by axis and never cut on the boundary pair. Position is
load-bearing: the 49 types emit only 47 distinct programs, and of the two
colliding pairs one is separated by the axes it may occupy while the other is
not. And at catalog scale no entry loses its original type, with ambiguity
confined to the single axis the alphabet analysis predicts. The full reading is
in `md/primitive_imasm_cycle.md`.

State the strength of this exactly, because it is easy to overclaim: the cycle
is NOT a bijection. It is bijective on eleven axes and two-to-one on the
twelfth, where the colliding pair shares an axis, so the reading is a SECTION of
the writing and not an inverse. Write a tuple, read it back, write again, and
the word returns identical; read a word cold and one axis may hold two answers.
`imasm cycle tuple=⟨…⟩` runs one tuple, catalog entry or not, and says per axis
whether it came back exactly, ambiguously, or not at all.

## Part X. Where the Engine Lives

The close-condition engine (Graph, ancestry pairing, ClosureState, and the whole
gate `word_verdict`) lives in `imasm_core/src/check.rs`: no_std + alloc, so the
verdict can be spoken wherever the kernel runs. `ask_native/src/imasm.rs` keeps
presentation, spectral analysis, and the tool registry as extensions over the
core Graph, and is the tool that answers `imasm check`. The tri-ancestral
verdict lives beside it in `imasm_core/src/imasm16_3.rs`.

The same engine runs on bare metal: mOMonadOS carries imasm_core, and its
on-board vita mouth (the vae_vita trunk baked to a raw blob and reimplemented in
no_std scalar f32) speaks certified turns whose words are gated by
`check::word_verdict` or, when the word carries tri tokens, the tri-ancestral
verdict. The kernel that judges your reasoning at the prompt is byte-for-byte
the kernel that judges the trunk's speech on the machine with no OS beneath it.

## Part XI. The Surface and the Guarantees

`imasm_composer.html` is a fully local, self-contained page (no external assets,
nothing leaves the machine). `imasm export` writes the manifest (every
registered tool with its graph, ports, and closure state, plus the opcode
table); the page renders that manifest as a node canvas: palette, drag, click an
out-port then an in-port to bind. It judges nothing and only SPEAKS command
lines (`compose`, `chaos`, `wire`, `eval`, `prove`) for the kernel to judge. One
grammar, one judge; the surface is a hand, not a head.

Engineering guarantees:

- Registry writes are atomic (temp file, then rename): a reader sees the old
  registry or the new one, never a torn one.
- A registry file that exists but does not parse is preserved as `.corrupt`
  evidence, never silently replaced by emptiness.
- Kernel verdicts name the spec they bind, so a refused re-define can never
  borrow an older program's green.
- An identity closure answers N for the program, in words, with the repair named
  (put a transforming opcode between the fork and the fuse).

## Part XIII. Rule of Thumb, Canonical Words, Pitfalls

Express a decision as a word ($⊢$ begin · $⊙$ self-identify · $≻$ move · $∈$ weigh
options · +/× the true/false arms · $∋$ resolve · $⊞$ hold paradox · ¬ commit ·
$⊣$ close), then `imasm check` it. Only branchers branch, only mergers fuse. Put
real WORK on the arms or it is N. Use `protocol` to close, never a bare `ring`.

Canonical words:

```
  $⊢$$∈$$≻$$⊤$$∋$$⊣$        lossless protocol: closes in shape AND value, recovers B → T
                 wired at three arms it is the same word, and on the FOUR slice
                 it flows identically, the third arm carrying nothing
  $⊢$$∈$$⊙$$∋$$⊣$         identity: reconnects, no work, μ∘δ=id → N
  $⊢$$∈$$⊙$$⊙$$⊙$$∋$$⊣$       tri identity: same reading → N
  $⊢$$∈$$⊞$$≻$$∋$$⊣$        closes over work AND holds paradox → B (paradox held)
  $⊢$$≻$$∈$$⊤$$⊥$$∋$$⊡$$⊣$      tri word driving the register toward full A (EVALT, EVALF on
                 the arms), fused and latched at $⊡$ → T
```

Pitfalls, all load-bearing:

- Reading a word as a line. It is a graph; the verb supplies the edges.
- Pairing $∈$/$∋$ by counting or by nearest-match. Pairing is ancestry over edges.
- Putting only $⊙$ between $∈$ and $∋$ and expecting T. That is N (identity).
- Expecting T from a word containing $⊞$. That is B (paradox held).
- Treating an open arm as a failure. It is a living end, reported not fatal.
- Closing a loop back to $⊢$. It has in-arity 0 and cannot be a target.
- Writing V/T/B or ← out of habit. Retired: they no longer parse → N (void).
- Pasting a bracketed word into the tool. Brackets parse to nothing → N (void).
- Treating the classic and trilattice faces as separate languages. They share
  the register, the ancestry rule, the close condition, the flow semantics, and
  the composition law; the differences are arity and the information-layer bits.
- Expecting T from the tri word `$⊢$$≻$$∈$$⊤$$⊥$$⊞$$∋$$⊡$$⊣$` under `imasm check`. $⊞$ is ENGAGR to
  the classic reading and EVALI to the trilattice one, and B beats T, so the
  classic checker answers B (paradox held) for it. One glyph, two readings: the
  collision is real and it is the next thing the notation has to settle.

## Part XIV. The Excription Loop: imasm learn

`imasm learn '<word>' [rounds=N] [breadth=K]` runs verification as imscription
on a MODEL. The word needs no shell quoting: $≺$ and $≻$ replaced < and > precisely so the
marks stop colliding with redirection, XML, and generics. Both
faces run: a word carrying tri tokens selects the SIXTEEN_3 grammar, any other
the classic grammar; one loop, one knowledge file.

Each round takes the neighborhood of the current word (single-opcode
substitutions, insertions, deletions from the face's body alphabet; the
boundary turnstiles held fixed; only grammar-valid candidates admitted). For
each candidate the model excribes the word into a GUESS: it names one concrete
object in a real domain whose structure is the word. The excriber is grounded
in the primitives: each opcode is tagged with the axis it rides (VINIT
Dimensionality, FSPLIT Granularity, EVALT Criticality, IFIX Topological
Protection, and so on), the twelve axes are given as tangible handles, and the
primitive types are loaded from ob3ect/digital as exemplars, each itself an
IMASM word. So the guess is read off the program's characteristics, not its
glyphs alone. The prompt carries one
worked example word with three wildly different excriptions of it (three
domains, one structure), teaching the fan-out rather than an answer; the
guessing domain itself is assigned, rotated by the word, so a small model
cannot collapse onto a single name. The guess is blinded (any leaked opcode
vocabulary excised), and a guess that parrots a spent example or an
already-taken guess is refused mechanically with one hotter retry in the next
domain over: distinct words must earn distinct names. A second reading
imscribes the guess alone back into a word. Both words are checked in the
word's face, and the residual is the edit distance between the word sent and
the word recovered: residual zero is the round trip closing, the operational
statement that excription and imscription compose to the identity on that
word, with the guessed object as the fixed point between them.

Where the residual is not zero, the aligned confusions are counted into
ob3ects/imasm_knowledge.json alongside the guess, distilled into lessons, and
the lessons ride the imscriber's next prompt: the knowledge update is the part
of the record that changes the next reading. The walk moves to the
highest-residual candidate, the frontier of its own ignorance, and each run
appends its mean residual to the accuracy trajectory, the curve the loop is
supposed to bend downward over time. The knowledge file persists atomically,
same discipline as the tool registry.

## Part XV. Promotion Paths Between Programs

Two 12-primitive tuples that differ have a promotion path: a walk that changes
one primitive at a time with every intermediate well-formed, the way
`recalibrate` walks one axis through its values. Two IMASM programs are the
same. `imasm path '<A>' '<B>'` finds the PROMOTION PATH from word A to word B:
the shortest sequence of single-opcode edits (substitute, insert, or delete one
glyph) in which every waypoint is itself a grammar-valid program. It is A* over
the graph of valid programs, the raw edit distance serving as the admissible
heuristic; it runs in either face, chosen by the words.

The learn loop's residual is the RAW edit distance between the word sent and the
word recovered. The promotion path is the stronger object built on the same
metric: the walk through valid programs only, and its verdict may climb along
the way. Substituting an inert IMSCRIB for a working opcode promotes an identity
closure (N) to a real closure (T) in one step, the program-space image of a
tuple's verdict rising under promotion. The tool reports the verdict walk and
says whether the path is a genuine promotion (the verdict changes) or a lateral
edit (it does not).
